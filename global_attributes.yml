  summary: "The QQ Scaled Climate Variables were created using a technique that reduces climate model biases by applying projected climate changes simulated by a climate model to observations. This technique produces application-ready data that is the same resolution as the observations used; typically much higher than the resolution of a GCM (e.g. 5km vs several hundred kilometres)."

  acknowledgement: "The data were created by the CSIRO Climate Innovation Hub with the assistance of resources from the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI Australia), an NCRIS enabled capability supported by the Australian Government. The data contain modified information from the Australian Government, Bureau of Meteorology and the CMIP5 multi-model dataset. The World Climate Research Programme’s Working Group on Coupled Modelling which is responsible for CMIP and climate modelling groups around the world make model output available to it. For CMIP the U.S. Department of Energy’s Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison provides coordinating support and led development of software infrastructure in partnership with the Global Organisation for Earth System Science Portals."
