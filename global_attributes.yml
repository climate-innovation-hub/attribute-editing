  summary: "The QQ Scaled Climate Variables were created using a technique that reduces climate model biases by applying projected climate changes simulated by a climate model to observations. This technique produces application-ready data that is the same resolution as the observations used; typically much higher than the resolution of a GCM (e.g. 5km vs several hundred kilometres)."
